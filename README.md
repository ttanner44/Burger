  ## Usage
  Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the top of the page -- waiting to be devoured.   Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. 
  
  ## User Story
  As a hamburger enthusiast, I want to track the burgers I like, which I have in inventory and those that I’ve already eaten.
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  When I add a burger, it adds the name to my list.; when I delete a burger, it removes it from my list.  When I save a burger on my list it separates them into those I’ve devoured and those that are ready to be eaten.  When I click the devoured button, it moves the burger to the devoured list.  When I click the Make me button, it moves the burger from the Make me list to the ready to be devoured list.
